# reddit Golang style guidelines

We follow the style enforced by the `gofmt` package provided by the Golang toolkit. Said style guide and best practices 
can be found on the [Effective Go page](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html). 
The [Go code-review comments wiki](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) makes for a good supplement for 
code style.
